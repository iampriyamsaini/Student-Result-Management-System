📚 Student Result Management System (React + JSON Server)

This project is a beginner-friendly CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React for managing student result data. It uses the Fetch API for all data operations and a local JSON Server to simulate a backend database.

The application adheres to the project requirement of using only React's useState for state management, avoiding useEffect for data fetching, which is instead triggered by manual user actions (like clicking "Load Students").

✨ Features

Add Student: Form to create and save a new student record.

View Students: Fetch and display all student records in a responsive table.

Edit Student: Form to modify an existing student's data.

Delete Student: Remove a student record permanently.

View Details: Simple read-only screen for a single student's complete result information.

Search/Filter: Filter the list dynamically by student Name or Section.

Sorting: Sort the list by ID, Name, Section, Marks, or Grade.

Data Fields Managed

id (Automatically generated by JSON Server)

name

section

marks (Number)

grade

⚙️ Prerequisites

Node.js

npm or yarn

JSON Server (Install globally for easy use: npm install -g json-server)

🚀 Project Setup and Run

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1. Install Dependencies

In the project's root directory (student-result-app/), run:

npm install
# OR
yarn install


2. Configure API URL

CRITICAL STEP: Open src/services/studentService.js. The current API_URL is set to a placeholder (e.g., http://192.168.1.8:3001/students).

You MUST change it to the standard localhost address for the JSON Server:

// src/services/studentService.js

// Change this line:
const API_URL = "http://localhost:3001/students";


3. Start the JSON Server (Backend)

The JSON Server reads the sample data from db.json and hosts the API. Run this command in your project root:

# Start JSON Server on port 3001, watching the db.json file
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001


Keep this terminal window open.

4. Start the React Application (Frontend)

In a separate terminal window, start the React development server:

npm start
# OR
yarn start


The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000. Click the "Load Students" button to fetch the initial data from db.json.
